# ELM Html, StartApp and Port

Testing how to build WebApplication using Elm.

Struggled with the DOM funciton focus(). Had to use ports. To be doing so I  had to desintegrate the nice StartApp, it's a pity. Maybe someone much smarter than me could cone up with a good solution.

Conclusion: DOM and Elm-FRP not always fit. I blame DOM for bad API design.

# ELM-STARTER!

For development i use the elm-starter, thanks to splodingsocks: https://github.com/splodingsocks/elm-starter.git
